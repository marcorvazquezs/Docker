# Image vs. Containers 

 * An image is the application we want to run 
 * A container is an instance of that image running as a process
 * You can have many containers running of the same image 

# Containers are not mini VM's
 * They are just processes 
 * Limited to what resources they can access 
 * exit when process stops
